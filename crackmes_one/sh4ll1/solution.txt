Solution to this crackme is 540, now on how I got this value.

1) Looking at the code there's two functions: `systemv` and `systemo`.
    `systemv` seems to be a very simple function that sets the value of a
    couple variables. `systemo` is where system input happens, as well as the
    check for a valid password.

2) 540 came from looking at the disassembly from `systemv` and `systemo`:

    `systemv`:
    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0x5
    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x7


    `systemo`:
    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8] ; move value of 0x7 to eax
    add    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],eax ; add 0x7, or content of eax, to 0x5
    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4] ; move 0xc to eax register
    imul   eax,eax,0x2d            ; multiply 0x2d and 0xc which is 0x21c
    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc],eax ; move 0x21c or 540 into rbp-0xc
    ...
    cmp    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc] ; compare the value inputed by the user to 540
