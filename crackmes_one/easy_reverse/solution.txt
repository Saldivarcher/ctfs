1) Get past the `argc` check, by providing an argument.

   cmp dword [var_4h], 2

2) Pass the `strlen` comparison, which is 0xa or 10. So any string of 
    length 10 will suffice.

   cmp rax, 0xa

3) To actually get the flag, the string provided must have the ascii
    character of 0x40 or '@'. This is due to the `al` register check;
    which is just a check on the lower 8 bits of the EAX register.
    The EAX register contains the string passed in by the user.

   cmp al, 0x40

So the solution to this crackme is: "@@@@@@@@@@"
