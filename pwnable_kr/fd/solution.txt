```
int fd = atoi( argv[1] ) - 0x1234;
int len = 0;
len = read(fd, buf, 32);
if(!strcmp("LETMEWIN\n", buf))
```
>>> 0x1234
4660
>>>
fd@ubuntu:~$ ./fd
pass argv[1] a number
fd@ubuntu:~$ ./fd 4660
LETMEWIN
good job :)
mommy! I think I know what a file descriptor is!!

Getting `fd` to be 0 is the solution in this, because that is stdin.
